; Problem:
; 
; DESIGN a function that consumes an image and determines whether the
; image is tall.
; 

(require 2htdp/image)

;; Image -> Boolean
;; produces "true" if the height of an image is longer than its width

(check-expect (tall? (rectangle 20 10 "solid" "red")) false)
(check-expect (tall? (rectangle 30 50 "solid" "purple")) true)
(check-expect (tall? (rectangle 10 10 "solid" "yellow")) false)
(check-expect (tall? (square 4 "solid" "orange")) false)


;(define (tall? img) false)     ; stub

;(define (tall? img)           ; template
;  (... bool))


(define (tall? img)
  (> (image-height img)
     (image-width img))
)
