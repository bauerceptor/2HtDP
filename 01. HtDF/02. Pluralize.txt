; Problem:
; 
; Design a function that pluralizes a given word.
; (Pluralize means to convert the word to its plural form.)
; For simplicity you may assume that just adding s is enough to pluralize a word.


;; String -> String
;; takes a word and pluralizes it by adding 's' at end of that word

(check-expect (pluralize "book") "books")
(check-expect (pluralize "") "s")
(check-expect (pluralize "me") "mes")


;(define (pluralize s) "")      ; this is a stub

;(define (pluralize s)
;  (... s))

(define (pluralize s)
  (string-append s "s"))
