; Problem:
; 
; Desgin a function called yell that consumes strings like "hello"
; and adds "!" to produce strings like "hello!".
; 
; Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.
; 
; Leave behind the commented out versions of the stub and template.


;; String -> String
;; add "!" to the end of str

(check-expect (yell "you") "you!")
(check-expect (yell "") "!")
(check-expect (yell "Sunday today") "Sunday today!")

;(define (yell str) "")      ; this is a stub

;(define (yell str)
;  (... str))

(define (yell str)
  (string-append str "!"))
